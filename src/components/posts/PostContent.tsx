            <p>Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some ideas in a sketchbook. This way,
                you can think things through before committing to an actual design project.</p>
            <p>But then I found a <a href="https://flowbite.com">component library based on Tailwind CSS called
                Flowbite</a>. It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as buttons, navigation
                bars, cards, form elements, and more which are conveniently built with the utility classes from
                Tailwind CSS.
